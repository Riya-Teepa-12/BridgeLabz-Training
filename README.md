### 📚 Concepts Studied

#### SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

#### Additional Design Principles
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)
- Separation of Concerns
- Programming to Interfaces
- Favor Composition over Inheritance

#### Object Calisthenics (Clean Code Rules)
- One level of indentation
- One dot per line
- Small, cohesive classes

### 🧩 Design Patterns
- Studied GoF design patterns overview:
  - Creational
  - Structural
  - Behavioral

#### Implemented Patterns
- Singleton
- Factory
- Observer
- Builder

### 📐 Analysis & Practice

### 🗓 Day 33 – Multithreading in Java  
**Date:** 02-Feb-2026

### 🧠 Concepts Learned
- Process vs Thread
- Benefits and drawbacks of multithreading

### 🔄 Java Thread Lifecycle
- NEW
- RUNNABLE
- BLOCKED
- WAITING
- TIMED_WAITING
- TERMINATED

### 🧵 Thread Creation Techniques
- Extending `Thread` class
- Implementing `Runnable` interface

### ⚙️ Core Thread Methods Practiced
- `start()`
- `sleep()`
- `join()`
- `yield()`
- `isAlive()`

### 🛠 Advanced Thread Concepts
- Thread priorities
- Daemon threads
- Thread interruption handling
- Synchronization for shared database resources

### 🚀 Performance Comparison
- Single-threaded vs Multi-threaded payroll insertion

### 🧪 Use Cases Implemented
- Parallel employee inserts
- Salary updates using threads
- Database consistency checks using JUnit
- Execution time logging and result validation with test cases

### 🔄 Version Control
- Committed and pushed all work
