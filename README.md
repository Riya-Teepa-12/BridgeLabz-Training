# 📅 Week 3 – Day 1  
## 📌 Topic: Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly & Circular)

This module focuses on understanding and implementing different types of **Linked Lists**, a core Data Structures concept.  
The objective is to strengthen traversal logic, pointer manipulation, and CRUD operations using real-world problem statements.

## 🔗 Linked List Types Covered

### 1️⃣ Singly Linked List
Each node contains:
- Data
- Reference to the next node

**Operations Implemented:**
- Add node at:
  - Beginning  
  - End  
  - Specific position  
- Delete node by ID  
- Search node by ID or Name  
- Update node data  
- Display all nodes  

**Use Case Examples:**
- Student Record Management  
- Inventory Management System  
- Employee Management System  

---

### 2️⃣ Doubly Linked List
Each node contains:
- Data
- Reference to the previous node
- Reference to the next node

**Operations Implemented:**
- Add node at beginning, end, or specific position  
- Remove node by unique ID  
- Search by title or author  
- Update availability/status  
- Display list:
  - Forward traversal  
  - Backward traversal  

**Use Case Example:**
- Library Management System  

---

### 3️⃣ Circular Linked List
The last node points back to the first node instead of `null`.

**Operations Implemented:**
- Add node at the end  
- Remove node by unique ID  
- Search by customer name or category  
- Display all nodes in circular manner  

**Use Case Example:**
- Online Ticket Reservation System

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understand differences between Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists  
- Implement efficient traversal and deletion logic  
- Handle edge cases (empty list, single node, head/tail deletion)  
- Apply linked list concepts to real-world problems  
- Improve problem-solving and pointer manipulation skills

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ / Eclipse  
- **Input Handling:** Scanner (No hard-coded values)
